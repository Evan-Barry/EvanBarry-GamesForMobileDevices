Assignment 2 Mobile Input

The scene "2_Touches" is the scene for the assignment

The scene contains 2 sets of objects: IControllable objects and objects for colliding with

The ICollidable objects are a cube, a capsule and 3 spheres. Each sphere demonstrates a different method for the drag but the drag method for an object can be selected in the inspector for the object under its IControllable script

The build for this project is set to iOS so the build may need to by changed for the device it is tested on and built again

Please feel free to contact me if you need my help with anything for this assignment
